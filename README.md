## Overview: Glacion is a web application that helps people find where they should live for their next job. The user is prompted with a city they would like to live in, a job they would like to have, and a time frame the job has been listed in. Glacion takes the user's information and displays a heat map overlay on a google map. High heat areas show where jobs are concentrated. This gives the user an idea of where they should move to.
